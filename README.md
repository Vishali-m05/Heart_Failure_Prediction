# 💓 Heart Failure Prediction
*A Machine Learning Project*

---

## 🎯 AIM

This project aims to **predict the risk of heart failure** using clinical records and machine learning algorithms. It involves **data preprocessing**, **exploratory analysis**, **model training**, and **evaluation** using a dataset of heart-related health parameters.

---

## 📝 Dataset Description

The dataset used (`heart.csv`) contains **clinical features** such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Diabetes status  
- Ejection fraction  
- And other medical indicators  

These features help in determining the likelihood of heart failure.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart failure based on the clinical data provided.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` → Data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` → ML models and preprocessing  
  - `imblearn` (SMOTE) → Handling class imbalance  
  - `pickle` → Saving the trained model  
  - `warnings` → Suppressing warnings

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

Implemented and compared the performance of:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

---

## 🔍 Key Steps Followed

1. ### 🧹 Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values (if any)
   - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
   - Handling class imbalance using `SMOTE`

2. ### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Understanding data distributions
   - Identifying correlations
   - Visualizing trends using graphs

3. ### 🔀 Train-Test Split:
   - Splitting the dataset using `train_test_split` to evaluate model performance

4. ### 🤖 Model Training & Evaluation:
   - Fitting models to the training data
   - Evaluating them on test data using performance metrics

5. ### 💾 Model Persistence:
   - Saving the best-performing model using `pickle` for deployment

---

## 📈 Metrics Used for Evaluation

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix** (visualized using `seaborn`)
